# automated_essay_scoring
Automated essay scoring using stylometric features on the texts using a dataset from an old Kaggle Competition from 2012: The Hewlett Foundation, Automated Essay Scoring. There are eight different essay sets which have texts ranging from 100 to 600 words. They each consist of around 1500 samples. These sets are divided according to the level of the student and the differences in their tasks. Some of them are dependent on a certain topic whereas others are general writing. They are written by students from 7th grade to 10th grade.


There is a report along with the code.
